1. Connected the previous node assignment to this assignment. Created a login 
page. Used usernames and passwords created in last assignment to login 
successfully.
2. Manually enterd the data in backend and verified that with frontend.
2. Created 4 pages using react components and react-router (Home, About-us, 
Jobs, Contact) . Made  separate folder structure for every component. 
3. Added a card component on each page giving detail about each page. (Similar to 
the"complex_component_single.htm" example shown in the class and in 
folder react scripts uploaded in files). Used react map() to create dynamic 
component at least on one of the page. 
4. Used CSS and some additional text to make pages pretty.
