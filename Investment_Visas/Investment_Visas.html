<section id="CBI"><h2 align="center">Citizenship by Investment</h2>
	<br><br>
	<h4> What is citizenship by investment?</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Citizenship by investment is a unique program that enables you to get a passport and citizenship of a given country, if you make an investment in this country’s economy. Citizenship by investment has become especially popular among wealthy individuals in the past several years and continues gaining popularity and attracting new investors.<br>Portugal has recently  started a Golden Visa program which allows investors to obtain permanent residence and citizenship status within 5 years.
		</li>
		
		

	</ul><br><br>
	<h4>Why do you need citizenship by investment?</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>In contrast to traditional immigration processes, obtaining second citizenship and passport is much easier and quicker through citizenship-by-investment programs. You don’t have to put your lives on hold or make other disruptions in your schedule. If you have high income, this “economic” citizenship may offer boundless opportunities to you.<br>There are plenty of reasons to invest in a second passport, ranging from visa-free travel to personal safety.</li>
		
	</ul>
	<br>
	<h4>Education</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Citizenship status automatically qualifies you as a domestic student, thereby offering you access to local world-class colleges and universities at a much smaller tuition fee.</li>	
	</ul>
	<br>
	<h4>Family</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Second citizenship programs allow members of the principal applicant’s family to become citizens of the new country too. It is a great opportunity to improve the lifestyle of your family members, by giving them access to better quality health care, schools and secure communities.</li>
		</ul>

	<br>
	<h4>Visa-free travel</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Passports of the countries that offer economic citizenship programs enable your visa-free travel to many countries of the world, including those of the Schengen Area. For example, Afghani citizens have visa-free access to 20 countries and territories in the world, while the Maltese passport exempts you from the necessity to get a visa for travel to as many as 167 countries!</li>
		</ul>

	<br>
	<h4>Safety and security</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, many countries of the world have experienced political turmoil and unrest, oftentimes accompanied by military action and property seizure. Second citizenship can offer you a “safe haven”, where you can be sure that nothing endangers your life and the life of your family.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<h4>Business</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>By obtaining your citizenship through investment, you not only get a second passport, but you also become an owner of a business/property. This opens new business opportunities for you, which you can easily explore by capitalising on your extended travel freedom.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<h4>Taxation</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Many countries that propose economic citizenship offer more favourable tax rates, which provides room for tax optimisation. In many countries, you have to pay tax only for the income earned in that country, with no taxes on global income.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<h4>Dual Citizenship</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Antigua and Barbuda, Cyprus, Dominica, Grenada, Malta, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Portugal allow dual citizenship. There is no need to renounce your first passport and citizenship.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<h4>What’s in it for the countries?</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The countries that offer citizenship by investment aspire to attract investments in their economies. For example, you may invest in real estate, land development and infrastructure projects in Cyprus, resort development in Grenada, or invest in the Sugar Industry Diversification Foundation in St. Kitts and Nevis.<br>You may learn more information about investment options, visa-free access and specific advantages and qualifications under the section for each country below.<br>Countries <b>Antigua & Barbuda,St Lucia,Grenada,Malta,St. Kitts & Nevis,Vanuatu</b> also offer you an opportunity to invest in land, real estate, property, resort villas and condominiums.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>

<ul> 
<li>We will begin the process of preparing a formal business plan, and initiate communication with designated incubators to solicit feedback and suggestions.</li><li>A Federal Corporation will be created for your client. As Federal law requires that 25% of the Board of Directors are Canadian permanent residents or citizens, we will appoint someone to sit on the board of directors of the company until such time as your client becomes a PR.</li></ul> 
<li>Letter of Support</li> 
<ul>

<li>Submit the Application for Permanent Residence</li>
<li>Launch the Start-up Business, and begin the business incubation period</li> 
<ul><li>At this stage, the applicant(s) must begin investing in their company, if they haven't already. The amount will depend on their business idea but we should expect at least CA$100,000 to ensure sufficient liquidity during the company's start up phase.  Please note, the business incubator may charge fees.  These fees will be paid from the start-up capital of the business.</li></ul>
<li>The applicant will become a permanent resident.</li> 
<ul><li>The success of the business is now in the applicant's hands, as he will be the principal driver of its growth.  To date the business to the next level, he may now need to invest additional capital, or raise capital from outside.</li>
